## About Me

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Data Science at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). Currently, I am a research intern at the [LDS Lab](https://data-science.ustc.edu.cn/_upload/tpl/15/04/5380/template5380/index.html) at USTC, advised by Prof.[Wenjie Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ma5DtmoAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof.[Fuli Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QePM4u8AAAAJ&hl=en). Besides, I am also a research intern at the [CSAIL Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) at MIT, advised by Prof.[Wojciech Matusik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=wbIMbL8AAAAJ). My research interests lie in NLP, generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).

**I sincerely appreciate the guidance and trust of my mentors and the support from senior students and teachers who have given me invaluable opportunities along the way.**

**<span style="color:red">I am looking for potential PhD positions. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me!</span>**

## Research Interests

**LLM/LMM Capability Enhancement & Human-AI Interaction**

Focus on advancing the core competencies of existing LLMs and LMMs—including boosting performance in specific tasks (e.g., mathematics, code generation, image understanding and generation) via techniques like fine-tuning and test-time scaling/training—while prioritizing the optimization of smooth, effective human-AI interaction.

**LLM/LMM-Driven Reliable Application & System Building**

Explore leveraging generative models’ strengthened capabilities to build reliable and trustworthy tools and systems, with a focus on serving specific tasks and cross-domain needs (e.g., statistics, economics).
