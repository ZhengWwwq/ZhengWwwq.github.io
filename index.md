## About Me

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Data Science at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). Currently, I am a research intern at the [LDS Lab](https://data-science.ustc.edu.cn/_upload/tpl/15/04/5380/template5380/index.html) at USTC, advised by Prof.[Wenjie Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ma5DtmoAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof.[Fuli Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QePM4u8AAAAJ&hl=en). Besides, I am also a research intern at the [CSAIL Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) at MIT, advised by Prof.[Wojciech Matusik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=wbIMbL8AAAAJ). My research interests lie in generative models, particularly Large Language Models and Large Multimodal Models.

## Research Interests

My current research interests include:
- Exploring how to leverage the strong capabilities of generative models to build reliable and powerful systems.
- Enhancing the abilities of existing LLMs and LMMs to perform specific tasks such as mathematics, code generation, and image generation.

## News

- **[Aug. 2025]** Our paper about academic paper evaluation leveraging LLMs has submitted to AAAI 2026.
- **[Jul. 2025]** Our paper about personalized image generation leveraging LMMs is accepted to ACM MM 2025 (Oral).
